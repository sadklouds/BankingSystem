I have Learning c# in my own time and thought I would recreate my first assignment from python in c#.

This is a simple simualted banking system with a admin login function and different bank account types.

Action abke to perform within this project:

Key: TBI = To Be Implemented

  Amin Login
  Search for a particular customer to perform various banking operations on a
  customer bank account i.e. check balance, deposit or withdraw money etc.
  Deposit money into a customer account
  Withdraw money from a customer account
  Check current balance for a customer
  View customer details e.g. name and address
  Update customer information e.g. name and address

  Close a customer account i.e. remove customer from the system
  Update admin own information i.e. name and address
  Print all customers details
  
  Customers can have different types of bank account. Accounts will differ in their
  name, interest rate and overdraft limit etc.
  The bank system should be able to store and load all customersâ€™ data from and
  into a file. (TBI)
  
  Transferring funds/money from one account to another. For example, an Admin
  can transfer funds from one customer account to another customer account.

  (TBI)
  
  Admins can request a management report. This should show the following
  information;

  o Total number of customers in the system
  o The sum of all money the customers currently have in their bank account.
  o Using individual account balance, the report should calculate the sum of
  interest rate payable to all accounts for one year, note, if customers have
  different account types, their rates will vary.
  o Total amount of overdrafts currently taken by all customers.
